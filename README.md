Installed executable flutterfire.
Warning: Pub installs executables into C:\Users\Templeton\AppData\Local\Pub\Cache\bin, which is not on your path.
You can fix that by adding that directory to your system's "Path" environment variable.
A web search for "configure windows path" will show you how.
Activated flutterfire_cli 0.2.7.
